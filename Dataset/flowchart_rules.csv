LT_1,Check that the flowchart has exactly one start node and one end node.
LT_2,"Ensure that all decision nodes contain clear, meaningful conditions."
LT_3,Verify that all nodes are connected; there are no orphan or isolated nodes.
LT_4,Confirm that node IDs are unique and appear in ascending order.
LT_5,Ensure that at least one valid path exists from the start to the end node.
LT_6,"Validate that all node types are from the allowed set (Start, End, Process, Decision)."
LT_7,"If loops exist, check that each has a proper termination condition."
LT_8,"All nodes must have clear, non-empty, meaningful labels."
LT_9,"Each decision node must have exactly two outgoing edges (e.g., Yes/No)."
PT_1,Generate and evaluate the flowchart against a simple school-level test case.
PT_2,Generate and evaluate a second test case for consistency.
PT_3,Test the flowchart against an edge or boundary case. Does it handle unexpected or unusual input?
PT_4,"Assess the logical efficiency of the flowchart â€” does it solve the problem with minimal, necessary steps?"
